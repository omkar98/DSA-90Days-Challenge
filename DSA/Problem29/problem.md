This is a new problem
```
<h1>Dutch National Flag Algorithm</h1>
```
1. Simple Sort using Collections or Arrays approach
2. Create 3 different arrays
    2.1. Array0 = [0,0,0]
    2.1. Array0 = [1,1,1]
    2.1. Array0 = [2,2,2]
    Then concat everything
3. Create 3 different variables: count0, count1, count2. Then simply replace the array with this count
4. Create 2 diffeent variables: count0, count2. Then middle portion will be 1 by default.
5. Dutch National Flag Algo in use now, where we will be able to sort IN-PLACE!
