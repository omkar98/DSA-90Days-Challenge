Tree Traversals -->
1. DFS(DepthFirstSearch) -> 3 types:
Inorder(LRRi), [Point your finger like ^ for whole tree]
   - Recursive (super simple)
   - Iterative
PreOrder(RLRi), [Point your finger like -> for whole tree]
   - Recursive (super simple)
   - Iterative 
     - Using 1 stack -> Store Root, Right, Left
PostOrder (LRiR) [Point your finger like <- for whole tree]
   - Recursive (super simple)
   - Iterative
2. BFS (BreadthFirstSearch) [easier] [Also called Level Order Traversal]
