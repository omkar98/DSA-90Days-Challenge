# K-th element of two sorted arrays

1. At first this seemed to be a simple problem, i.e we are implementing the ptr apporach, we used in merge sort algo, with an additional O(n) space complexity.
2. But when I saw striver's video, I got to know that this can be solved in O(log(n)) time. Prerequisite is to know the finding the median of two sorted arrays.

We can also use the same median approach in the merge sort to get the sorted array.
