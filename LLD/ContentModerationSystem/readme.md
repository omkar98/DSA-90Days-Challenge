# Project Idea: A Content Moderation System for a Social Media Platform

## Description:
The platform moderates posts submitted by users before publishing them. It implements multiple moderation levels:

1. **Text Filtering**:
    - Removes offensive words.

2. **Spam Detection**:
    - Identifies and prevents spammy content.

3. **User Validation**:
    - Checks if the user is banned or inactive.

---

## Additional Features:

1. **Post Retrieval via Proxy**:
    - Implements caching for frequently accessed posts to improve performance.

2. **Graceful Handling for Inactive/Banned Users**:
    - Uses a **Null Object Pattern** to handle cases where users are banned or inactive without throwing exceptions.

3. **Scalable Moderation Rules**:
    - Implements the **Composite Pattern** to group moderation rules into composite rules, ensuring scalability and better manageability.

---

## Design Patterns Used:

1. **Proxy Pattern**:
    - Used for caching frequently accessed posts during retrieval.

2. **Null Object Pattern**:
    - Gracefully handles scenarios involving inactive or banned users.

3. **Composite Pattern**:
    - Groups multiple moderation rules into a single composite rule for scalability and cleaner design.

---

## Benefits:
- Modular and maintainable design.
- Improved performance with caching.
- Scalable moderation rule management.
- Graceful error handling for edge cases (e.g., inactive users).
